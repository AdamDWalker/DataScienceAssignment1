# DATA PREP
#     Data Exploring
#         How many observations/variables
#         Variable Categories?
#         Extreme/Missing values?

#         DISTRIBUTIONS???
#         Present findings - Tables/Plots

#     Data Pre-Processing
#         Clean the data set - Extreme/Missing values
#         Standardise/Normalise required? Why?

# MODEL TRAINING
#     Candidate Models?
#     Why?
#     Why split into training and testing sets
#     What method of splitting?
#     Are all variables required? Why?

# MODEL EVALUATION
#     How is a model chosen?
#     How can the AUC result be improved?
#     Other pre-processing methods that can improve the AUC results?
